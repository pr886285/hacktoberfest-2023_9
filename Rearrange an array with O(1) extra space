Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in the range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that the transformed array arrT[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].

NOTE: arr and arrT are both same variables, representing the array before and after transformation respectively.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {1,0}
Output: 0 1
Explanation: 
arr[arr[0]] = arr[1] = 0
arr[arr[1]] = arr[0] = 1
So, arrT becomes {0, 1}




def rearrangeArray(arr, N):
    for i in range(N):
        arr[i] += (arr[arr[i]] % N) * N

    for i in range(N):
        arr[i] = arr[i] // N

# Example usage
N = 2
arr = [1, 0]
rearrangeArray(arr, N)
print(arr)
